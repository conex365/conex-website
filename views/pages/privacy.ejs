                We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not
                store your card data on their servers. The data is encrypted
                through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
                (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction
                data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your
                purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase
                transaction information is not saved.
                <br />
                Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
                managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint
                effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                Discover.
                <br />
                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit
                card information by our store and its service providers.
